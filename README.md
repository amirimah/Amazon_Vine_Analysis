# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The objective of this project is to use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. The dataset selected for this project is furniture products. Next, we will determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members (a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products) in the dataset.
